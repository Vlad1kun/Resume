                            Exploring The Data</h3>
                            <div class="understanding__pBox">
                                <p class="itemunderstanding">Instax  is a brand of instant still cameras and instant films marketed by Fujifilm. The first camera and accompanying film, the Instax Mini 10 and Instax Mini film, were released on November 10, 1998. The "Wide" film and first accompanying camera were released the following year. The Instax Square film and accompanying camera were released in 2017. Especially popularity grew in 2020-2022 after the use of cameras by bloggers.</p> 
                                <p class="itemunderstanding">As you can see, the history of Instax is incredibly rich. Almost every year the company pleases users with new models of instant cameras and printers. And if at the initial stage the devices could be purchased only in large cities, for example, Moscow or St. Petersburg, today the Instax line is presented in all well-known electronics stores from Vladivostok to Kaliningrad.</p> 
                                <p class="itemunderstanding">Famous bloggers, photographers, artists and actors who actively use gadgets in everyday life, work and creativity play an important role in the popularization of instant cameras. However, it is worth noting that the Instax audience is rather narrow, since it is not a mass market in the usual sense of the word. But at the same time, due to the low price of instant cameras, almost all connoisseurs of film photography can afford to buy.</p>
                                <p class="itemunderstanding">Instax plans, of course, to develop new models of cameras and instant printers that can surprise even the most demanding photographers. The use of modern technologies allows Instax to always remain in trend, without losing its "lamp" and special charm.</p>

                            <p class="itemunderstanding">As the popularity of the brand grows, it is necessary to create a user-friendly product that will not only be innovative, but also interactive and pleasant for the user..</p> 
                            <p class="itemunderstanding">My task was to create a design for an application where you can choose any camera model to buy. And also create a camera user profile page..</p>
                            <p class="itemunderstanding">After the user takes a photo, the user, as a result, has not only a physical photo, he also has the opportunity to digitize the photo and share it in the Instax profile.</p>

                        <p class="itemunderstanding">A key feature of the target audience is the mix of photography novices and experts, which requires design to strike a balance between clear visualization and in-depth knowledge.</p>
